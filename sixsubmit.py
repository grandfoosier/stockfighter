 To summarize, my three pieces of evidence pointing to account 
 RAH5051135 as the anomaly were:

 1. It had the largest (fractional) discrepancy between average bid quantity 
      and average ask quantity - 251 to 1,425, respectively. 
      This is what led me to piece #2.
 2. It was the only account to repeatedly return to the same position after 
      selling off a large number of shares. Although I canâ€™t be certain, 
      I would bet that it was selling to a position of zero.
 3. It had the highest gained value per trade, and per share traded, 
      among all accounts on the exchange.
