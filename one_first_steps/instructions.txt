Welcome to Your New Job
These instructions are always available under the Instructions 
tab if you need to see them again.

Congrats on being employed at Rodriguez & Mills. We're sure you'll 
love it here. You have been granted control over account RAM72921891 
and have full authority to conduct trades on it... subject to the 
not-so-watchful eye of our risk management desk, naturally.

First order of business: This is a blotter interface. It connects your 
terminal to EOJO Rome Exchange (EJREX), a well-regarded stock exchange. 
We've pre-loaded it to track your first assignment, the shares of Heavy 
Department Stores (HDS).

Your Goal
Get acquainted with this interface.
Watch the market participants trade a bit.
When you're ready, purchase 100 shares. (Try using a market order. Not 
sure about what that means? Read about Order Types in the instructions 
menu.)

You'll Be Fired If
The risk management desk is at an offsite today. Parachuting into a 
volcano, apparently. No rules until Monday!
